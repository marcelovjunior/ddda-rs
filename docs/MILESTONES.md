# Milestones

Each milestone is a route the players can actually do, with a gate checked
against the original game. Co-op comes early (M3) on purpose: it validates
the architecture before many systems are built on it.

| # | Route | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **M0** | Foundation: tooling, exe identity, DTI class registry labelled in Ghidra, `.arc` reader, data inventory | Every `.arc` in nativePC opens and lists entries; DTI names applied to the Ghidra project |
| **M1** | Look: load one area (Cassardis) and fly a free camera through it | Screenshot comparison against the original at fixed camera poses |
| **M2** | Walk: an Arisen with skeleton and animations, movement, collision and the third-person camera | Walk a fixed path; positions and timing match a recording within tolerance |
| **M3** | Together: host and client on LAN, two Arisen walking Cassardis | Both see each other move smoothly; client input is applied by the host |
| **M4** | Fight: one enemy type, basic combat, the main pawn following and fighting | Damage numbers and enemy behaviour match the original for a scripted fight |
| **M5+** | NPCs, dialogue with the interaction lock, quests, the opening, then outward through the campaign | Per-route |

## Status

**Active: M0** (started 2026-10-08)

Done:
- JDK 21 (Temurin 21.0.12) installed; Ghidra 12.1.4 runs headless.
- Analysis copy of DDDA.exe unpacked with Steamless 3.1.0.5 (SteamStub 3.1).
- Exe imported into `E:\ddda-re\ghidra\DDDA.gpr`; auto-analysis done
  (11.5 min, 33,870 functions). Backup in `E:\ddda-re\ghidra-backups`.
- GhidraMCP 6.0.0 built against 12.1.4, running on 127.0.0.1:8089,
  registered with Claude Code as `ghidra-ddda` (user scope).
- Repo created with a whitelist `.gitignore`, AGENTS.md, method and co-op
  design docs.
- Format survey (`E:\ddda-re\notes\formats-survey.md`): 8,536 `.arc` v7
  archives, 358k zlib entries, 144 resource types; MIT specs available
  (Albam, Riftstone).
- DTI class registry harvested: 4,405 classes, 4,343 vtables, 25,791
  virtual functions named ([DTI.md](DTI.md)). Reproducible from
  `research/dti` (identical label set verified).
- DTI labels applied to the Ghidra project. Vtable runs trimmed at the
  first non-code word (143 vtables); the 57 functions an earlier run had
  created at non-code addresses were removed. Final state 2026-10-08
  20:10: 30,540 functions and 13,153 data labels named, 0 failures.
- `mtarc` crate (ARC v7 reader) and `ddtool` CLI. **Gate passed
  2026-10-08:** `ddtool arc-scan <nativePC> --inflate` opens all 8,536
  archives, inflates all 358,431 entries to their recorded sizes, 144
  types all named from the DTI registry, 0 failures, 33 s.

**Active: M1** (Look: one area with a free camera)

Done (format readers; checked by re-running the scans 2026-10-08 20:05):
- `mttex`: all 73,706 `rTexture` v0x99 parse. Format byte to D3DFORMAT
  is the exe's own table at `0x01440698` (byte-for-byte; one copying
  slip at index 4 fixed).
- `mtmod`, `mtmrl`, `mtshader`: all 28,094 models (70.2M vertices, 71.3M
  triangles) and 28,152 material lists parse. All 2,077,947 material
  commands resolve through `BbsShaderPackage.mfx`, which also gives the 24
  vertex layouts. Format notes are in [FORMATS.md](FORMATS.md).
- World placement rule from the live game ([WORLD.md](WORLD.md)).

Open data anomalies (unexplained, not yet ruled harmless):
- 123,205 of 70.2M normals off unit length by more than 0.05.
- 25,811 skinned vertices reference a joint at or above the bone count.

Viewer (`ddvfs`, `ddview`), first renders 2026-10-08 20:30:
- Fixed before it would build or show anything: a compile error, the cell
  model path (folder comes from A, not B), corrupted build artifacts
  from the drive failure (`cargo clean`), and screenshots taken before
  Bevy's async pipeline compilation finished (`--shot-delay`, default
  10 s).
- 5x5 cells around `st100_58m50n` load and join seamlessly (25 cells,
  231 meshes, 56,527 triangles, 28 textures, 0 problems): the placement
  rule holds. Triangles are CCW-front against the stored normals (12,000
  vs 2 in four cells), so Bevy's default culling is right.
- The ground-level shot from the live player pose shows plausible terrain.
  **Not yet compared with the original game**: no reference screenshot.

Missing for the M1 gate:
- Reference screenshots from the original game at recorded poses.
- Placed objects (buildings, trees, props: the `lot` archives), water
  models, terrain layer blending (only the base albedo is drawn), the
  stage's own lighting (sun and ambient are placeholders).
- Handedness (a possible mirror) is unresolved until a reference shot
  exists.

Next action: get a reference screenshot of the original at the recorded
pose, then read the `lot` placement archives.
