# upon-a-pawn: q0002 "Upon a Pawn": the first pawn and the goblins

- **Owner:** codex lane
- **Branch:** `task/upon-a-pawn`
- **Board area:** `story/q0002`
- **Status:** open

Part of the opening slice. Read `docs/OPENING_SLICE.md` first,
especially its rule: build the system, not the step.

## Goal

Trace and run q0002 from its boot (GSF 381): its scripts, QCT, events and NPCs. That covers the first pawn, the goblins harassing a woman, and recruitment into the party. The goblins use the existing runtime. The maintainer reports goblins "looked weird" in play: compare their look (shading, skinning, materials) against an original capture at the same time of day, and fix any defect or record why it differs.

**Rules.** Trace in the exe and label any guesses (AGENTS.md). Live
checks may control the game, with the safety rules in `docs/CODEX.md`.
Test runs use `--unattended`.

## Scope

- `crates/ddstory/**`
- `crates/ddhost/**`
- `crates/ddpawn/**`
- `crates/ddview/src/opening.rs` (claim)
- `docs/QUESTS.md`
- `docs/PAWNS.md`
- this brief's Results

Shared viewer files need a board claim and coordination with the
agent that holds them.

## Done when

q0002 plays from its boot to its clear in `--opening`, the first pawn joins the party, and the state matches the original's. Fill in Results and report to `head`.
