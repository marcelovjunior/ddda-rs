# L28: the CRT functions still marked `platform`

Owner: claude-3, branch `task/L28-crt` (cut from `task/L17-seh-workers`,
whose recorder it needs), worktree `E:\ddda-rs-wt\L17BC`, data set
`E:/ddda-re/notes/native-L17` (the one the boot, L21, generates from).

## Why

The boot (L21) passes `__heap_init`, `__mtinit`, `__RTC_Initialize` and
`__ioinit`, then stops at `__setargv` -> `__setmbcp` 0x012FB049, which has
no lifted body. 116 inventory rows still have status `platform`, rule
`CRT/library range`: `___updatetlocinfo`, `__control87`,
`___set_fpsr_sse2`, `__fpmath`, `___tzset`, the 64-bit division helpers,
stdio/lowio (`__fsopen`, `_fread_s`, `_fclose`, `__read`, `__lseek`,
`__close`, `__commit`, `__alloc_osfhnd`, `__getstream`, `flsall`,
`__fcloseall`), `FID_conflict:_memcpy` 0x012EDE40 and about 60 `FUN_` in
0x012E0EA0..0x0132A390. Per RUNTIME.md they are lifted and verified like
everything else, never written as services.

## Task

1. Census the class: which are still platform-only, and why the earlier
   CRT lifting (L14/L15) skipped them.
2. Bring them into the normal flow (scan, vectors, gen, required-vector
   replay) with a general rule, not by address.
3. Lift rejections go to claude-6 (L22, lifter rejections).
4. Tell claude-2 (L21) as each group lands.

## Rules

As L17: heavy jobs only through `E:/ddda-re/tools/heavy.py`,
`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4`, `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, at most six vector workers,
existing records and cases unchanged unless a documented boundary change
requires it, no address special cases, no pushes.

## Results

(draft; numbers after the pause lifts)

**Census (native-L17, after L17's recording).** The 116 rows are not
excluded from any scan: `structured_inputs.py prepare` takes every row whose
status is not `verified`. The status is only stale because the inventory
was not rebuilt. They split into:

| Group | Rows | Why no fixture |
|---|---:|---|
| Lift rejections | 68 | lifter: x87-return/unsupported, STMXCSR/LDMXCSR/FNCLEX, RCR (all six 64-bit division helpers), the memcpy 0x012EDE40 table, PMAXSW/PSLLDQ/RSQRTPS/PAUSE/REPNE. Handed to claude-6; most are fixed on `task/L22-lift-rejections` (STMXCSR/LDMXCSR remain: guest MXCSR needs sticky SSE flags) |
| Recorder failures calling the SEH helpers | 28 | the recorder mocked `__SEH_prolog4`/`__SEH_epilog4`, so the frame never moved and the function's `ret` popped its scope table (e.g. `__setmbcp`: "returned to 0x0161EBE0" under every strategy) |
| Other recorder failures | 16 | noreturn and unwind paths (`_abort`, `__exit`, `___crtExitProcess`, `__math_exit`, `__global_unwind2`, `_EH4_GlobalUnwind2`, `__CallSettingFrame@12`), eight `FUN_` and `vf14` |
| Fixtures from L17's passes | 4 | `vf20` 0x0130A800, `vf31` 0x0130AAC0, 0x013201C0, 0x01320700 |

Across all 418 remaining candidates, 33 call an SEH helper.

The 16 other recorder failures, with every reason seen across the L17
passes (all strategies):

| Address | Function | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 0x012ED9DD | `___crtExitProcess` | noreturn call (ExitProcess path) |
| 0x012EDC4B | `__exit` | noreturn target |
| 0x012EE1A1 | `vf14` | noreturn target |
| 0x012F9E95 | `_abort` | noreturn target |
| 0x013006FE | FUN_013006FE | unmasked x87 exceptions (FLDCW input) |
| 0x0130070B | `__math_exit` | unmasked x87 exceptions (FLDCW input) |
| 0x012FF0F0 | `__CallSettingFrame@12` | execution outside the image (calls a funclet address from its argument) |
| 0x01303CD2 | `_EH4_GlobalUnwind2` | execution outside the image |
| 0x01306FD0 | `__global_unwind2` | execution outside the image; overwritten return |
| 0x012E1DA1 | FUN_012E1DA1 | execution outside the image |
| 0x012F9D82 | FUN_012F9D82 | execution outside the image; runaway |
| 0x012F0D4C, 0x012F37AD, 0x012F45C4, 0x0132A1EC | FUN_ | NaN/Inf float input |
| 0x01314A90 | FUN_01314A90 | NaN/Inf float input; runaway |

The four noreturn bodies cannot have a returning fixture under the current
contract (the recorder rejects noreturn paths by design); the unwind group
needs exception-dispatch state (a runtime task, L15/L17).

**Rule: promotion of verified call-free callees.**
`structured_inputs.py promote` re-lifts a selected ext entry as a closed
callee when (a) its arms make no call at all, (b) no recorded case mocks it,
and (c) some unverified candidate calls it directly. Its own cases are
re-recorded in closed mode with its previous input distribution. Because
the recorder and the replay both run closed targets for real (the replay's
dispatch table and `run_sparse`'s `lifted` set), no existing case changes
meaning; only the promoted entries' own records and cases are replaced.
Callers then run the original `__SEH_prolog4`/`__SEH_epilog4` (verified
under L17's caller-frame contract) inside their own fixtures.

PENDING: promote, fresh prepare, the L17 pass protocol, replay, counts,
what verifies, the noreturn/unwind remainder, adoption.
